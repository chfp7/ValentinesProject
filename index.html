<h2>You.</h2>
<p>
	Let me start with your face, ur cheeks as soft as the clouds that roam above us. Your eyes that shine so bright, you give me hope when I stare at them. 
	Lashes that lashed my heart as quick as it beats. Your nose that touches mine when we kiss. Your hair that looks good in any style. Your smile thats engraved
	in my brain forever. Ok now lets explore your body, nah u already know what I think. In this letter/card I want you to know how amazing and special you are,
	 and no its not just your looks that you're blessed with.

<h2>My love for you</h2>
<p>
	My love for you cant be measured, your beauty is unmatched, I hate using the word perfect 
	but thats all I can think when I'm with you. I know, perfect is too much, nobody is perfect,
	 but I always forget any imperfections you may have which are so little and insignificant.
	I believe you are way too smart for me, too kind, too GENTLE AND LOVABLE AND ALL. "Why do 
	I deserve you?" I always ask. The only answer I have is you are a gift from God, that motivates me,
	makes me happy, makes me think. Rethink. and refine myself. I love you. <3

	<h2>Our Second Valentines</h2>
	<p>
		Yes, its our second Valentines together. We did so much together, many adventures... faced
		many problems together... I learned so much from you and I dont expect learning will stop.
		I still feel like I know you for years not just a year and 6 months. How can a person never
		get bored of the other for so long? We saw eachother so often, couldn't have a day without
		you with no feeling of an empty void inside me. This year I learned that I was right the entire time.
		You are the one for me. Now let me tell you why.

		<h2>You..</h2>
		<p>
			I sweat over the heat you make me feel, despite it being so cold. Your face is like a piece of art,
			the more I see it, the more valuable it gets. I love how your eyes make my heart tingle, the feeling
			comfort you give when you touch my hand, how happy I get when I see you smile, or even better, when 
			you uncontrollably laugh. I love the way you are passionate about things. I love the way you always
			give it your all despite how much it bothers you. I love the way you keep up with me. I love the way
			we rival eachother. I love you.

			<h2>Never Fail</h2>
			<p>
				You never fail to surprise me. When you get that rep, win that competition, or just prove everyone wrong,
				 prove everyone that you're not just capable. You will do it! You never fail in completing the job, You truly
				impressed me and inspired me during Fall semester The pressure you went through while still killing it in uni
				or your fashion project. I was as impressed as Dr Maroun was when he found out that we didnt know about a DOB.
				I truly appreciate you, I pray to God I keep writing more of these in the future. I truly am in love with you <3
