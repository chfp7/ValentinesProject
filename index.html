<h2>You.</h2>
<p>
	Let me start with your face, ur cheeks as soft as the clouds that roam above us. Your eyes that shine so bright, you give me hope when I stare at them. 
	Lashes that lashed my heart as quick as it beats. Your nose that touches mine when we kiss. Your hair that looks good in any style. Your smile thats engraved
	in my brain forever. Ok now lets explore your body, nah u already know what I think. In this letter/card I want you to know how amazing and special you are,
	 and no its not just your looks that you're blessed with.

<h2>My love for you</h2>
<p>
	My love for you cant be measured, your beauty is unmatched, I hate using the word perfect 
	but thats all I can think when I'm with you. I know, perfect is too much, nobody is perfect,
	 but I always forget any imperfections you may have which are so little and insignificant.
	I believe you are way too smart for me, too kind, too GENTLE AND LOVABLE AND ALL. "Why do 
	I deserve you?" I always ask. The only answer I have is you are a gift from God, that motivates me,
	makes me happy, makes me think. Rethink. and refine myself. I love you. <3
